## üîç Key Takeaways

- **Base Case WACC**: 7.14%, calculated using CAPM for cost of equity (7.80%), cost of debt (2.88%), and a 12% effective tax rate.
- **Terminal Growth Rate**: 4%, supported by Oracle‚Äôs expansion into high-growth markets like AI, multicloud, and recurring cloud revenue.
- **Fair Value Estimate**: $207 per share. Compared to Oracle‚Äôs market price of ~$255, the stock appears **overvalued** based on conservative FCF recovery.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Valuation ranges from $105 to $185 depending on WACC and terminal growth assumptions.

## üß† Key Insight
- Oracle reported negative free cash flow in FY25, driven by a surge in capital expenditures as the company rapidly builds out its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to meet growing demand from AI workloads. This does not indicate a weakness in the business model but rather a strategic investment phase.
- Instead of using a flat FCF growth assumption, the model separates operating cash flow and CapEx, allowing a more accurate reflection of the company‚Äôs investment cycle. This approach assumes near-term pressure on free cash flow due to high CapEx, followed by a rebound in later years as cloud infrastructure spending moderates and recurring revenue increases. The base case assumes a return to $27B in FCF by 2030, supporting a long-term view of Oracle as a scalable and resilient cash-generating business.
