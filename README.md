# Oracle Corporation DCF Valuation - 2025
Completed a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to assess its fair value amid the company‚Äôs strategic push into cloud infrastructure and AI computing.

## üìà Market Outlook & Forecast Justification
To support the base case assumptions in this valuation, I included external forecasts and recent company performance data that highlight Oracle‚Äôs long-term growth potential.
## Analysts Forecast Strong Growth
According to Simply Wall St, Oracle is expected to deliver:
- **Revenue growth**: 14.5% per year
- **Earnings growth**: 16.6% per year
- **EPS growth**: 15.6% per year
- **Return on equity**: 35.8% in the next 3 years
These estimates support the optimistic revenue growth used in the model and justify the base case terminal growth rate of 4.0%.
## Cloud Acceleration in FY26
Oracle‚Äôs cloud business is scaling aggressively. According to their Q4 FY25 earnings release:
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** grew 52% year-over-year in Q4 FY25
- **Expected cloud growth in FY26** is projected to exceed 70%
- **Total cloud revenue (apps + infrastructure)** is forecasted to rise from 24% to over 40%
- **Multicloud revenue** grew 115% quarter-over-quarter
These trends help justify the projected recovery in free cash flow and reinforce Oracle‚Äôs potential to generate long-term cash through cloud and AI services.

## üîç Key Takeaways
- **Free Cash Flow Forecast (2026‚Äì2030)**: Based on revenue growth, a 32% operating cash flow margin, and elevated CapEx reflecting Oracle‚Äôs $21B+ investment in cloud infrastructure.
- **Base Case WACC**: 7.14%, calculated using CAPM for cost of equity (7.80%), cost of debt (2.88%), and a 12% effective tax rate.
- **Terminal Growth Rate**: 4%, supported by Oracle‚Äôs expansion into high-growth markets like AI, multicloud, and recurring cloud revenue.
- **Fair Value Estimate**: $207 per share. Compared to Oracle‚Äôs market price of ~$255, the stock appears **overvalued** based on conservative FCF recovery.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Valuation ranges from $105 to $185 depending on WACC and terminal growth assumptions.



## üß† Key Insight
- Oracle reported negative free cash flow in FY25, driven by a surge in capital expenditures as the company rapidly builds out its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to meet growing demand from AI workloads. This does not indicate a weakness in the business model but rather a strategic investment phase.
- Instead of using a flat FCF growth assumption, the model separates operating cash flow and CapEx, allowing a more accurate reflection of the company‚Äôs investment cycle. This approach assumes near-term pressure on free cash flow due to high CapEx, followed by a rebound in later years as cloud infrastructure spending moderates and recurring revenue increases. The base case assumes a return to $27B in FCF by 2030, supporting a long-term view of Oracle as a scalable and resilient cash-generating business.
